      The primary motive behind phishing attacks is to illicitly obtain
      sensitive information from individuals or organizations for malicious
      purposes. Attackers aim to steal personal or financial data, such as login
      credentials, credit card numbers, or other confidential information, which
      can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to
      secure systems. In some cases, phishing is employed to gain initial access
      to a network, allowing attackers to deploy further malicious activities,
      such as installing malware or conducting more sophisticated attacks.
      Ultimately, the goal is to exploit the compromised information for
      financial gain, data theft, or to achieve other criminal objectives.
