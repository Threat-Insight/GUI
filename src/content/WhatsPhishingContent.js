      Phishing is a form of cyberattack where perpetrators impersonate
      legitimate organizations or individuals to deceive victims into disclosing
      confidential information. This deception typically occurs through emails,
      text messages, or social media, where attackers create a sense of urgency
      or trust to prompt the recipient to click on malicious links, open
      infected attachments, or provide sensitive data such as passwords or
      financial details. The aim is to exploit the victim's trust or urgency to
      gain unauthorized access to their personal or financial information.

      To defend against phishing, it is essential to implement comprehensive
      cybersecurity measures including advanced email filtering systems and
      regular user training programs. Educating users to recognize suspicious
      communications, verify the authenticity of requests for sensitive
      information, and employ multifactor authentication can significantly
      reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing schemes. Additionally,
      organizations should encourage vigilance and establish protocols for
      reporting potential phishing attempts to enhance overall security.
